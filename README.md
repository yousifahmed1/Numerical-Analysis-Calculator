# Numerical Analysis Calculator Using Flutter

Flutter project.

The Numerical Analysis Calculator project in Dart implements essential mathematical methods including bisection, false position, fixed point iteration, secant, Newton-Raphson, Gauss-Jordan, Gauss elimination, LU decomposition, and Cramer's rule. These methods enable efficient solutions to equations, root finding, and matrix operations.
